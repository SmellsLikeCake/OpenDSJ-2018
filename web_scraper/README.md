Hey Glenn, 

Please add info about the web_scraper in this file. (Feel free to delete my comments afterwards)

Such as how it works.

How to run it in your local environment.

Which python are you using?

Are there any other libraries/dependencies 

If someone wanted to add on to your web_scraping code, what could be improved?

Are there any flaws or caveats we should know about?

Thanks for your hard work,
Annie
