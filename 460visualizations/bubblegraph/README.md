## About this directory
`/bubblegraph` directory contains python code that will create a bubble graph visualization.

Currently, the graph visualizes the data in `/bubblegraph/files`. 
Currently, the data in `/bubblegraph/files` only contains Silicon Valley Pac's Form 460's.

## Where we left off
Anel Nurkayeva was in the process of adding "filters". So you could exclude or include categories in the visualization.
